# Ownership of the per-task cloud state a cloud-placed spawn leaves in the home
# the task lives in.
#
# A cloud crewmate cannot read the operator's provider account directly, so
# bin/fm-spawn.sh copies the account credential into
# <task home>/state/<id>.cloud-account/ for the worker lifecycle to stage.
# Nothing owned its removal, so every completed cloud task left a plaintext
# auth.json behind indefinitely, contradicting the invariant in
# docs/azure-workers.md that provider-account credentials never enter the
# control home. This library is that owner; teardown, withdraw, surrender, the
# spawn's rollback and the re-spawn sweep all call it.
#
# ONE ENUMERATION. The per-task file set used to be spelled out in three
# places (here, the re-spawn sweep, and the spawn rollback), so a name added to
# one was invisible to the others. Every name now appears exactly once, below,
# and callers select whole groups. Adding a per-task cloud file means adding it
# to one group here and nowhere else.
#
# WHICH home. Since the compartment-child task-home split, the home a task
# lives in is NOT always the home that owns the elastic-worker controller
# document: a secondmate compartment's child stages its credential in the
# COMPARTMENT's home while every lifecycle command for it runs with FM_HOME on
# the primary. So the caller must pass the state directory of the home the TASK
# lives in, and the removers deliberately do not guess:
#   - bin/fm-spawn.sh passes $STATE, the directory it just staged into.
#   - bin/fm-teardown.sh passes the state directory of the home whose task it
#     is ($STATE for its own task, $sub_state for a secondmate home's child).
#   - bin/fm-worker-lifecycle.sh runs on the primary and cannot know, so the
#     controller tells it: the authorized task home is durable on the queue
#     item and the worker record, and withdraw/surrender echo it back on their
#     receipts. That is the same value the spawn passed to --task-home and the
#     controller authorized under its lock, so stager and remover cannot
#     disagree, and nothing keyed on task id alone can redirect a removal into
#     a home that merely reuses that id.

#
# Consequence worth naming: withdraw and surrender now remove it too, and
# bin/fm-spawn-cloud-monitor.sh reads it when landing an outcome bundle. Both
