# Herdr tracking pane for one cloud-placed crewmate.
#
# The crewmate itself runs on an elastic Azure worker; this process is the
# local endpoint that keeps it visible and reapable in the same Herdr
# workspace as local crewmates. It renders the durable lifecycle state
# (queue/assignment from the worker controller, then the bounded execute log)
# and exits only after the digest-bound result is in local custody and its
# assignment has released, so endpoint loss can never strand account or
# capacity ownership behind an otherwise successful worker exit.
#
# Convergence duty: when the spawn-time reconcile left the request queued
# (transient admission evidence), a LATER reconcile assigns the worker after
# the spawn process is gone. This monitor is the surviving local owner, so on
# seeing status=assigned it dispatches the persisted entrypoint through the
# same bounded execute the spawn would have run. The dispatch marker file is
# claimed with O_EXCL and shared with fm-spawn.sh, so exactly one owner
# dispatches at a time; a claim whose bounded execute is provably over (marker
# older than the wall plus slack) with no result is reclaimed, which is safe
# because the lifecycle execute is digest-idempotent.
