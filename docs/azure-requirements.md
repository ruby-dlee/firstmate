# Azure fleet requirements

This document owns what running Firstmate on Azure is required to do, and how far the build has
got toward each requirement.
The five component documents (`docs/azure-pilot.md`, `docs/azure-runner.md`,
`docs/azure-validation.md`, `docs/azure-crosscheck.md`, `docs/azure-workers.md`) own the
mechanics of what is built.
Where a component document contradicts a requirement here, the requirement is authoritative and
that document is corrected as the requirement lands.

## Rule of construction

The owner stated these requirements and knows what the fleet must do.
A built design that contradicts one of them is a misinterpretation to be corrected, not a
constraint to report back.
Two such contradictions were found on 2026-08-18 and both are recorded below as design defects,
in R2/R3 and in R6.

Every state line in this document is a claim about the build that must be re-checked before it is
relied on, and a status is only moved to DONE with the acceptance criterion actually met.

## The requirements

Stated by the owner on 2026-08-18:

> "firstmate can spawn secondmates and crewmates in azure (and those secondmates can spawn
> crewmates in azure), and no-mistakes runs on azure, and all of this on pi-codex multi-profile,
> and cross-check works (with codex reviewing claude work and claude reviewing codex work), and
> everything is logged in, auth refreshes on its own, everything is set up and proven"

Added the same day:

- Crosscheck wall time must drop from about 75 minutes to 20 to 30 minutes.
- "The only requirement is that we can run many crewmates and no-mistakes/cross-checks in
  parallel without resource contention."
- A cost guard, so that a day's spend cannot quietly reach 100 dollars.
- "For cross-check, just use the same pi fleet (or copy it in, whatever works)."

## R1. Crewmates run in Azure

Status: DONE.

`config/spawn-cloud=azure` is set and accepted by `bin/fm-spawn.sh`'s own parser, and a crewmate
has run end to end in Azure.
Placement is still single-profile; multi-profile placement is R5, not a residual of this item.

## R2/R3. Secondmates run in Azure, and can spawn crewmates in Azure

Status: NOT DONE, and the current build refuses it.

`docs/azure-workers.md` states that a worker never runs Firstmate, a secondmate, another
supervisor, or a nested team, and `bin/fm-spawn.sh` states that secondmate and account-recovery
spawns always stay local.

The fear behind that rule is sound: a worker must not be able to create unbounded child compute.
It was written as a blanket refusal of the requested architecture rather than as a bound on child
compute, and that is the defect.

The correction is a secondmate compartment class distinct from the crewmate worker.
It runs a secondmate in Azure, and its child spawns go through the local controller's durable
queue: the secondmate enqueues a worker request and the controller reconciles and creates it.
No child-worker launcher exists on the worker, and the requested hierarchy still works, with
firstmate spawning secondmates in Azure and those secondmates obtaining crewmates in Azure.

Work: a new compartment role and lifecycle class; endpoint and steering reachability for a
compartment that outlives one task; a guest-to-controller request path; cost and capacity
accounting for that longer life; and a rewrite of the two statements above.

Acceptance: a secondmate running on an Azure worker requests a crewmate worker, the controller
creates it, the crewmate completes a task, and both release cleanly.

## R4. no-mistakes runs on Azure

Status: PARTIAL, and neither lane functions today.

Two lanes exist.
The validation-cell lane (`docs/azure-validation.md`) has never closed a cell; there is no
`azure-validation` state under `$FM_HOME/state`.
The shard-receipt strand that prevented a cell from closing was fixed, and that fix is still
unproven against a live cell.
The runner-offload lane (`FM_AZURE_RUNNER_REMOTE_CLASSES`) has no caller: nothing sets
`FM_AZURE_RUNNER_TASK`, `FM_AZURE_RUNNER_GENERATION`, or `FM_AZURE_RUNNER_CONFIRM_SUBSCRIPTION`.
Selecting a remote class therefore makes `bin/fm-no-mistakes-test-command.sh` skip the entire
local suite and then fail, with no fallback by design, so the setting stays off until its caller
exists.

Work: build the caller that derives the per-run bindings from the ambient no-mistakes run, then
drive one validation cell from dispatch to close.

Acceptance: a no-mistakes run offloads a test class to Azure and returns a real verdict; and,
separately, one validation cell reaches `close` with its worktree disk released.

## R5. All of it runs on the pi multi-profile fleet

Status: PARTIAL.

Crosscheck is done: eight pi profiles across eight distinct upstream accounts, projected into
single-profile account homes by `bin/fm-pi-account-home.py`, with the roster repointed and read
back through the real `bin/fm-crosscheck.py` reader and policy screen.
Crewmate placement is not wired: the cell image carries pi, but placement does not select across
the eight profiles.

Work: multi-profile account selection for crewmate and worker placement, reusing the projection
tool and the account-lease identity already present in the worker request path.

Acceptance: concurrent crewmates run on distinct pi profiles with no account collision.

## R6. Crosscheck is bidirectional across providers

Status: NOT DONE.

The requirement is codex reviewing claude work and claude reviewing codex work.
The roster was instead made eight reviewers all on `openai-codex`, by reading "just use the same
pi fleet" as a restriction to one provider.
It was not one, and that is the defect.

pi drives `anthropic`, `openai`, and `openai-codex`, so one pi fleet and cross-provider review are
compatible: the same harness, different providers, distinct accounts.
No image rebake is needed, because the model image already carries pi.

Work: anthropic profiles added to the pi fleet, which needs an owner login; a roster carrying both
providers; `config/crosscheck-same-model` turned off; and authors present on both providers so
review is genuinely bidirectional rather than one-directional.

Acceptance: a claude-authored change is reviewed by a codex-backed reviewer and a codex-authored
change by a claude-backed reviewer, both through pi, on distinct accounts.

## R7. Everything is logged in

Status: FRAGILE, and superseded in practice by R8.

The eight pi profiles are valid until 2026-08-25.
The `~/.local/share/agent-fleet/accounts/claude/` pool holds blanked, length-zero tokens and is
abandoned.

## R8. Auth refreshes on its own

Status: NOT STARTED. Hard deadline 2026-08-25.

Nothing in Firstmate refreshes a token.
`bin/fm-credential-expiry.py` is the detector and stops at the actuator by design.

The mechanism exists in pi: `@earendil-works/pi-ai` performs the OAuth refresh and returns a
rotated refresh token, and pi's file-backed auth storage persists it under its own lock.

It must run host-side.
The reviewer compartment's egress allowlist is Azure DNS plus one provider API host and
deliberately no auth host, so a token can never be refreshed inside the VM.
Refresh on the host, then stage a fresh credential.

Work: a refresher that runs pi's own refresh per profile ahead of expiry, writes back through pi's
lock, re-projects the account homes, and is scheduled.

Acceptance: profiles refresh unattended across an expiry boundary with no human login, and
`bin/fm-credential-expiry.py report` shows every profile usable afterward.

## R9. Everything is set up and proven

Status: NOT DONE.

Unproven today: the worker landing path; any validation cell closing; any pi review on the current
model image; and secondmate-in-Azure, which is blocked on R2/R3.

The landing path is not synthetically exercisable, and that is correct behavior rather than a gap
to route around.
`--outcome-dir` requires full staging, and `request` derives every binding from
`$FM_HOME/state/<task>.meta`, with caller-supplied bindings refused outside the hermetic test
backstop.
The existing smoke assignments cannot be reused because their `repository_generation` is not a
commit that exists.
Proving it requires a real spawned crewmate task that commits.

## C1. Crosscheck completes in 20 to 30 minutes

Status: NOT ADDRESSED.

Four parallel lanes (`FM_AZURE_CROSSCHECK_LANES`, default 4) predate this work and nothing about
duration has changed.
The 75 minutes has never been broken down.

Work: instrument create, boot, stage, review, and collect, then pull the lever the measurement
identifies.
Candidates are reviewer VMs that already exist rather than a cold create per review, a faster SKU,
or more lanes, and the choice waits on the measurement.

Acceptance: a measured review completes in 20 to 30 minutes, with the breakdown recorded.

## C2. Many crewmates, no-mistakes, and crosschecks run in parallel without contention

Status: NOT DONE.

The controller holds a single `pending_action`, so every provider mutation serializes.
That is the direct blocker on this requirement.

Work: per-assignment pending state, so reconcile drives many workers concurrently, with
idempotency preserved per action rather than globally.

Acceptance: several crewmates, a no-mistakes offload, and a crosscheck run concurrently without
the controller serializing them.

## C3. Cost guard

Status: HOLDING.

Spend is inside the commissioning ceiling and workers idle-deallocate on their own.
Every new lane stays inside that ceiling, and a lane that keeps compute alive between tasks states
its own cost bound before it is enabled.

## Order of work

1. R8, because the deadline is 2026-08-25 and everything else stops without it.
2. C2, because contention blocks demonstrating anything at scale.
3. R2/R3, the largest architectural gap and the requirement most misread by the current build.
4. R6, which needs an owner login before it can be finished.
5. R4, which needs the runner caller built and one validation cell closed.
6. R5.
7. C1, measured before it is changed.
8. R9, which is the proof of the rest.

## Standing constraints

Everything enters `main` through a pull request with green CI, and CI is verified to have run
against the head commit rather than against an earlier one.
Every pull request gets a fresh adversarial review before merge, which mutates the production call
site, proves the mutation applied, and confirms the test that should catch it is invoked.
`require_landed_code()` and `require_landed_clean()` are never weakened.
No token value is ever printed or logged; digests, paths, and expiry instants only.
