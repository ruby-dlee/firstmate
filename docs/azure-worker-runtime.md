# Azure worker crewmate runtime and payload plane (design)

Status: BUILT, with the post-2026-08-25 return path awaiting its bounded live ship and scout acceptance.
D1-D3 (runtime image, payload plane, worker-coordinate entrypoint), D5 (landing v1), and D6 (provider-neutral local custody plus release) have shipped in code; docs/azure-workers.md is the authority for their built behavior and this document keeps the design history.
This document owns the design for the pieces between "a worker executes a
digest-bound argv" (proven live 2026-08-17 on vm-fm7c799d-wkr-01) and "a real
pi crewmate does task work in the cloud".

## What is proven and what is missing

Proven live: request -> reconcile -> assignment, pinned supervisor bootstrap,
data-disk preparation (/mnt/account lun0, /mnt/task lun1), bounded execute
with digest-bound fm.worker-execution-result/v1, TTL, Herdr tracking endpoint
with queued-spawn convergence (PR 227).

Items 1 to 6 below were the original gap list.
They are now BUILT (1 to 4 by D1-D3, 5 by D5, and 6 by D6), and docs/azure-workers.md owns their behavior.
They are kept here only so the decisions that follow read against the problem they solved.

1. BUILT. Runtime: pi and node did not exist on the worker. Workers booted the
   raw Canonical Ubuntu 24.04 base; bootstrap installed only the supervisor.
2. BUILT. Repository materialization: /mnt/task held nothing; worktree_binding
   was an identity digest, not content.
3. BUILT. Task files: the entrypoint (CLOUD_WORKER_LAUNCH) referenced the brief
   at the LOCAL $FM_HOME/data/<id>/brief.md and the pi extension at the LOCAL
   state/<id>.pi-ext.ts; neither existed on the worker, and the launch string
   was never rewritten to worker paths.
4. BUILT. Account custody: fm-spawn.sh recorded account_home as "the binding
   the worker lifecycle stages", but no staging existed; /mnt/account was empty.
5. BUILT as landing v1 (D5), and NOT as direct-PR: no credential enters the
   worker. The crewmate's commits ride home as a digest-verified bundle and the
   local side keeps the landing authority. Direct push from a worker remains
   explicitly deferred.
6a. BUILT. An explicit `execute --existing-task-disk` recovery binds the already-assigned repository without staging over it, runs one bounded continuation or no-op collection command, and returns the same authorized report, status, commit, and scratch bundle.
   The request binds the exact landed recovery-supervisor digest, and the adapter executes those bytes without replacing the assignment's originally bootstrapped supervisor.
6. BUILT. Release no longer waits for ordinary teardown.
   The monitor localizes the digest-bound return, reconstructs the ship branch or retains scout scratch, writes the required report and terminal status, mints the cloud-custody release receipt while the exact tracking endpoint is finishing, and retries release/reconcile until the assignment is complete.

## Decisions

### D1. Runtime rides the golden image, not per-boot downloads

Extend `bin/fm-azure-cell-image.sh` to stage, next to the existing pinned
closures, a worker-runtime closure under /opt/fm-tools:

- node 22 (the nodesource tarball the bake already pins for cells), and
- the pi CLI closure: `npm install --prefix /opt/fm-tools/pi-agent
  @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@<pinned>` performed AT BAKE TIME on the
  builder VM, archived with a recorded sha256 like every other staged tool.

Then parameterize the worker image in docs/azure-pilot/main.json
(`workerImageId`, defaulting to the current Canonical literal so the change
is inert until the parameter is supplied) and point it at the new gallery
version. Rationale: workers are egress-sealed by posture; per-boot registry
downloads are both a provenance hole and a boot-time failure mode, while the
image is a cache of a recorded provenance chain (the bake doc's own model).
Ordinary author workers do not stage the local Pi extension pack because one worker runs one leased account.

### D2. One payload archive per assignment, over the private staging lane

At execute time the lifecycle already uploads a canonical request blob
privately. Add one sibling payload archive, assembled by fm-spawn at dispatch
(and persisted for the convergence path exactly like the entrypoint):

- `repo.bundle`: a `git bundle` of the leased treehouse worktree's HEAD (the
  exact repository_generation the bindings already record). A bundle needs no
  credentials on either side and materializes with `git clone repo.bundle`.
- `brief.md`, `pi-ext.ts`: the two task files the entrypoint reads.
- `payload.json`: manifest with per-file sha256 and the archive's own digest
  recorded into the execute request, so the guest verifies before use.

The supervisor gains a staging step before argv execution: fetch the payload
over the private endpoint (the worker identity's container role already
scopes it to its own state container), verify digests, clone the bundle into
/mnt/task/repo, place task files under /mnt/task/.fm-task/.

### D3. The cloud entrypoint is built in worker coordinates

fm-spawn already special-cases the cloud lane (pi-only, dispatch bypassed).
Build CLOUD_WORKER_LAUNCH against a fixed worker layout instead of local
paths: brief at /mnt/task/.fm-task/brief.md, extension at
/mnt/task/.fm-task/pi-ext.ts, cwd /mnt/task/repo (the supervisor's
FM_WORKER_WORKTREE moves to the cloned repo), PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR=
/mnt/account/pi-agent, PATH extended with /opt/fm-tools/node/bin and
/opt/fm-tools/pi-agent/bin. The local lane's launch construction is untouched;
the worker layout is a constant contract, asserted by the guest before exec.

### D4. Account custody copies the crosscheck model-compartment pattern

The pi account material (auth.json plus the minimal agent settings) is
packaged at dispatch into its own private blob, encrypted to the same custody
rules the crosscheck lane already follows for reviewer credentials: never in
ARM parameters, never in controller output or logs, fetched by the guest over
the private endpoint, staged onto the encrypted account disk
(/mnt/account/pi-agent), deleted from staging after the assignment's terminal
state. The account_binding digest the bindings already carry is verified
against the staged material before the entrypoint runs.

### D5. Landing v1: commits ride the task disk; the local side pushes

No provider or GitHub credential enters the worker in v1. The crewmate
commits locally in /mnt/task/repo; after the bounded execute the supervisor
bundles `repo -> outcome.bundle` (new commits only) into the state container.
The tracking monitor, on result landing, fetches the outcome bundle into the
leased LOCAL worktree, where the ordinary landing flow (push, PR, Bugbot,
teardown's landed-work check) proceeds unchanged. This keeps the landing
authority and the release receipts exactly where docs/azure-workers.md
already puts them. Direct push from workers (with a scoped deploy token) is
explicitly deferred; it changes the custody story and should be its own
decision when the soak data says the round-trip is too slow.

### D6. The return monitor releases cloud capacity after local custody

For `placement=azure` tasks, the digest-bound return carries the authorized report, status, visuals, repository commits, and scratch in one provider-neutral Git bundle.
The local monitor validates and publishes those bytes, reconstructs the required `fm/<task>` branch for ship work, synthesizes a truthful terminal status, and then mints `fm.worker-release/v2` while the task metadata and worktree still exist.
The receipt's landing authority proves local custody, not remote forge landing, so remote worker capacity can be released before the later ordinary teardown continues locally.
Release and reconcile are idempotent retries, and local credential staging is removed only after the controller queue entry is complete.

## Sequencing

1. Bake: extend fm-azure-cell-image.sh with the worker-runtime closure; new
   gallery version. (No behavior change for anything until 3.)
2. Payload: bundle+brief+extension archive at dispatch, supervisor staging
   with digest verification, worker-coordinate entrypoint. Hermetic tests
   drive the REAL supervisor staging against fixture blobs.
3. Flip: workerImageId parameter supplied; one live crewmate smoke on a real
   task; the crosscheck lane reviews the whole stack (it gates its own
   producer now).
4. Landing: authorized return bundle, exact task-branch reconstruction, local report/status publication, and release after custody (D5/D6, BUILT).
   The push stays where it always was, in the ordinary local landing flow.
5. Wide soak (8 then 16 lanes) only after 3 and 4 hold.

## Non-goals

- No account rotation or OAuth material inside a worker runtime bundle.
- Ordinary author workers keep their existing extension-free runtime.
- No public egress from workers; every transfer stays on the private lane.
- No captain-on-cloud changes; that is its own phase with its own custody
  design (setup-token) and is tracked outside this document.
