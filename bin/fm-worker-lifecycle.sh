# Queue-driven provider-neutral lifecycle for one-task elastic workers.
#
# This wrapper never decides that work is landed and never deletes ambiguous
# work. The exact lifecycle, Azure setup, release receipt, recovery, cost, and
# acceptance contracts live in docs/azure-workers.md.
#
# Required environment:
#   FM_HOME
#   FM_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
#   FM_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_GENERATION
#   FM_AZURE_OWNER_TAG
#   FM_AZURE_NAMING_PREFIX
#   FM_AZURE_STORAGE_NAME (Azure adapter)
#
# Optional policy:
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_POLICY_PHASE=commissioning|steady
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_STEADY_TARGET_USD=1000
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_COMMISSIONING_CEILING_USD=1500
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_HOUR_PLANNING_THRESHOLD=3500
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_ADMISSION_HOURS=24
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_IDLE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=300
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_DAILY_BOUND_USD=100        (unset = 100; <=0 or non-numeric refuses)
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_DAILY_BOUND_OVERRIDE=<utc-day>  (exact current day only)
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_IDLE_RELEASE_SECONDS=14400 (600..604800)
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_MAX=16
#   FM_AZURE_WORKER_WARM_IDLE=0
#   FM_WORKER_PROVIDER_COMMAND='python3 <provider-adapter>'
