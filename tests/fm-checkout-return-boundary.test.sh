# Tests for the destructive Treehouse-return boundary walk in
# bin/fm-checkout-lock-lib.sh (fm_checkout_treehouse_return_locked).
#
# The walk exists to prove that `treehouse return --force` cannot ESCAPE the
# worktree it is pointed at. It must refuse a redirected target - a symlinked
# path component, a non-directory, a mount point, a cross-device child - and it
# must NOT refuse a tree merely because ordinary symlinks live inside it.
#
# That distinction is the regression this file pins. The walk originally
# refused on ANY symlink entry anywhere in the tree, which made every repo
# whose own committed layout uses symlinks permanently un-reapable: relvino
# carries 177 of them in every worktree (its CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md convention
# and its symlinked skills), so no crewmate there could ever be torn down. A
# symlink ENTRY cannot redirect this operation - it is inspected with
# follow_symlinks=False, it is not a directory so it is never queued for
# descent, and each descent opens with O_NOFOLLOW and re-proves identity,
# single-device, and non-mount. Only a symlinked ANCESTOR redirects, and that
# is still refused. This matches how fm-teardown.sh's sibling validator
# (removal_tree_operation) has always treated in-tree symlinks: skip, never
# follow.
#
# The embedded program is extracted from the library rather than reimplemented,
# so these assertions cannot drift away from the code they describe. It ends in
# execvp("treehouse", ...), so with a stub treehouse on PATH exit 0 means the
# boundary was ACCEPTED and exit 74 means it was REFUSED.
