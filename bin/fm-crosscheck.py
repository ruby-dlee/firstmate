# the model selector, the Pi provider slot, the chat-completions api surface,

# instruction and schema, GLM-5.2 returns "```json\n{...}\n```", and a bare
# parse of that fails with `Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)` - byte
# for byte the failure that cost the lane its first review attempt.
#
# The rule is "EXACTLY ONE complete fenced block in the message", which is
# deterministic and never asks the gate to choose: with one block there is
# nothing to pick between, so surrounding prose is harmless and unwrapping is
# safe. Several complete blocks refuse, because then the gate WOULD be
# choosing which one was the verdict. Requiring the fence to span the whole
# message instead would re-break the lane the first time a model prefaces its
# answer with a sentence, and the point of a registry-driven lane is that the
# next model does not need the prompt re-tuned.
