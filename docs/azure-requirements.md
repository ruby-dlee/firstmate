# Azure fleet requirements

This document owns what running Firstmate on Azure is required to do, and how far the build has
got toward each requirement.
The five component documents (`docs/azure-pilot.md`, `docs/azure-runner.md`,
`docs/azure-validation.md`, `docs/azure-crosscheck.md`, `docs/azure-workers.md`) own the
mechanics of what is built.
Where a component document contradicts a requirement here, the requirement is authoritative and
that document is corrected as the requirement lands.

## Rule of construction

The owner stated these requirements and knows what the fleet must do.
A built design that contradicts one of them is a misinterpretation to be corrected, not a
constraint to report back.
Two such contradictions were found on 2026-08-18 and both are recorded below as design defects,
in R2/R3 and in R6.

Every state line in this document is a claim about the build that must be re-checked before it is
relied on, and a status is only moved to DONE with the acceptance criterion actually met.

## The requirements

Stated by the owner on 2026-08-18:

> "firstmate can spawn secondmates and crewmates in azure (and those secondmates can spawn
> crewmates in azure), and no-mistakes runs on azure, and all of this on pi-codex multi-profile,
> and cross-check works (with codex reviewing claude work and claude reviewing codex work), and
> everything is logged in, auth refreshes on its own, everything is set up and proven"

Added the same day:

- Crosscheck wall time must drop from about 75 minutes to 20 to 30 minutes.
- "The only requirement is that we can run many crewmates and no-mistakes/cross-checks in
  parallel without resource contention."
- A cost guard, so that a day's spend cannot quietly reach 100 dollars.
- "For cross-check, just use the same pi fleet (or copy it in, whatever works)."

Amended by the owner on 2026-08-19: the crosscheck requirement is that no author's work is
reviewed only by its own model family, not the literal codex/claude pairing quoted above.
The second reviewer family is GLM-5.2 on Azure AI Foundry.
pi-anthropic was rejected the same day (API pricing), as was an interim same-day
Claude-Code-CLI-subscription direction, and an interim Kimi-K2.7-Code pick was revised to
GLM-5.2 the same day on model quality. Details and work in R6.

Amended again by the owner later on 2026-08-19: crosscheck routes through GLM only. A single
reviewer family outside both author families satisfies the paradigm for every author, unbinds
review capacity from the pi-codex subscription profiles the fleet's own work depends on, and
makes the lane scalable for firstmate and for engineers' on-demand use. pi-codex stays as an
explicit fallback whose activation must be easy to see. no-mistakes stays on pi-codex.
The owner also directed a Slack v1 team exposure of crosscheck, recorded as R10.

## R1. Crewmates run in Azure

Status: DONE.

`config/spawn-cloud=azure` is set and accepted by `bin/fm-spawn.sh`'s own parser, and a crewmate
has been created, staged, and executed in Azure with exit 0.
No crewmate has returned an outcome, which is R9 rather than a residual of this item.
Placement is still single-profile; multi-profile placement is R5.

## R2/R3. Secondmates run in Azure, and can spawn crewmates in Azure

Status: NOT DONE, and the current build refuses it.

`docs/azure-workers.md` states that a worker never runs Firstmate, a secondmate, another
supervisor, or a nested team, and `bin/fm-spawn.sh` states that secondmate and account-recovery
spawns always stay local.

The fear behind that rule is sound: a worker must not be able to create unbounded child compute.
It was written as a blanket refusal of the requested architecture rather than as a bound on child
compute, and that is the defect.

The correction is a secondmate compartment class distinct from the crewmate worker.
It runs a secondmate in Azure, and its child spawns go through the local controller's durable
queue: the secondmate enqueues a worker request and the controller reconciles and creates it.
No child-worker launcher exists on the worker, and the requested hierarchy still works, with
firstmate spawning secondmates in Azure and those secondmates obtaining crewmates in Azure.

Work: a new compartment role and lifecycle class; endpoint and steering reachability for a
compartment that outlives one task; a guest-to-controller request path; cost and capacity
accounting for that longer life; and a rewrite of the two statements above.

Acceptance: a secondmate running on an Azure worker requests a crewmate worker, the controller
creates it, the crewmate completes a task, and both release cleanly.

## R4. no-mistakes runs on Azure

Status: PARTIAL, and neither lane functions today.

Two lanes exist.
The validation-cell lane (`docs/azure-validation.md`) has never closed a cell; there is no
`azure-validation` state under `$FM_HOME/state`.
A stranding strand was fixed: a passed run carrying a short receipt set is now demoted to failed
so the cell collects and retains legibly.
That buys legibility, not closing, and the root cause (an in-cell bridge producing no receipts) is
untouched, so a demoted cell still cannot `close`.
The one stranded work disk that sat on the subscription was deleted by the owner's direction on
2026-08-19 after no cell record could be found anywhere for the sanctioned close, so the lane's
inability to close now has no live residue, only the unfixed root cause.
The runner-offload lane (`FM_AZURE_RUNNER_REMOTE_CLASSES`) has no caller: nothing in the
repository sets `FM_AZURE_RUNNER_TASK`, `FM_AZURE_RUNNER_GENERATION`, or
`FM_AZURE_RUNNER_CONFIRM_SUBSCRIPTION`, and the placeholders in `docs/azure-runner.md` are an
operator recipe rather than a caller.
Selecting the `test` class therefore routes every non-Herdr test to Azure and keeps only the
Herdr lifecycle scripts local; with no caller supplying the bindings the dispatch fails, so those
non-Herdr tests run nowhere and the step exits 1.
There is no automatic fallback to the host, and `FM_AZURE_RUNNER_LOCAL_RECOVERY_CLASSES` is the
explicit operator opt-out that restores the full local run.

Work: build the caller that derives the per-run bindings from the ambient no-mistakes run, then
drive one validation cell from dispatch to close.

Acceptance: a no-mistakes run offloads a test class to Azure and returns a real verdict; and,
separately, one validation cell reaches `close` with its worktree disk released.

## R5. All of it runs on the pi multi-profile fleet

Status: PARTIAL.

Crosscheck on the pi fleet is done at the roster level: eight pi profiles across eight distinct
upstream accounts, projected into single-profile account homes by `bin/fm-pi-account-home.py`,
with the roster repointed and read back through the real `bin/fm-crosscheck.py` reader and
policy screen. Under the second 2026-08-19 amendment this roster is now the dormant crosscheck
fallback; the pi fleet's primary duties are authors and no-mistakes.
Crewmate placement is not wired: the cell image carries pi, but placement does not select across
the eight profiles.

Work: multi-profile account selection for crewmate and worker placement, reusing the projection
tool and the account-lease identity already present in the worker request path.

Acceptance: concurrent crewmates run on distinct pi profiles with no account collision.

## R6. Crosscheck reviews outside the author's model family

Status: NOT DONE. Direction decided by the owner 2026-08-19 (see the second amendment above).

The requirement is that no author's work is reviewed only by its own model family.
The roster was instead made eight reviewers all on `openai-codex`, by reading "just use the same
pi fleet" as a restriction to one provider.
It was not one, and that is the defect.

The provider question was settled on 2026-08-19.
pi-anthropic is dead twice over: pi's anthropic OAuth authenticates as its own client against its
own token endpoint, so a Claude CLI refresh token cannot be spent by pi, and a fresh pi-anthropic
login would bill at API pricing, which the owner rejected.
An interim directive the same day routed claude reviews through the Claude Code CLI on the
owner's subscription profile; a later interim pick was Kimi-K2.7-Code; the standing decision is
GLM-5.2 through the Fireworks AI lane on Foundry (`FW-GLM-5.2`, pay-per-token Data Zone Standard
US; at decision time it carries tool calling, a 1M-token context, and `reasoning_effort` with
`max` as the default - re-verify at deploy time), chosen on model quality with lineage
independent of both OpenAI and Anthropic.
The custody trade was accepted by the owner on 2026-08-19 knowing its exact shape: Microsoft
disclaims data handling for the Fireworks lane (data is shared between Microsoft and Fireworks
and processed on Fireworks infrastructure inside the US data zone), and the zero-data-retention
promise (volatile memory only, no logging by default, on the chat-completions surface) is
Fireworks' own policy, not Microsoft's. The lane must therefore use plain chat completions
only; the Responses API retains data for 30 days under its default store flag and is forbidden
here.
Billing was verified before acceptance: Fireworks pay-per-token on Foundry bills as Azure
consumption (a feature registration, not a Marketplace SaaS purchase), is MACC-eligible, and
Microsoft's own Startups material states startup credits apply to exactly this SKU; a small live
spend must confirm the credit decrement before volume. Fireworks pay-per-token models can retire
on 15 days notice, which is an accepted operational risk and one more reason the fallback below
stays armed.
Later the same day the owner simplified the routing: ALL crosscheck reviews route through the
GLM lane, for codex-authored and claude-authored work alike. GLM belongs to neither author
family, so single-family review is avoided for every author with one reviewer lane, and review
capacity stops competing with the pi-codex subscription profiles that no-mistakes and the
author fleet consume. The pi-codex roster (which R5 records as proven at the roster level while
R9 still owes the live proof) is retained as a dormant fallback behind a config flip, never
deleted; every review must name the lane that produced it, and a status read must show whether
GLM is serving or the fallback is active, so a silent fallback is impossible.
Fallback operation is a recorded degradation, not free service restoration: with the fallback
active, codex-authored work is reviewed by its own family again (the flip therefore includes
`config/crosscheck-same-model` on for the duration, which the policy screen otherwise refuses),
which is exactly the defect this requirement removes - accepted only while GLM is unavailable,
and one more reason fallback activation must be loud.
The model pick is explicitly provisional: reevaluate after live review data (Kimi-K2.7-Code was
the prior same-day pick; the comparison and the custody/billing verification are in the owner's
evidence folder, R6-FOUNDRY-RESEARCH-2026-08-19.md).

No owner login is needed anymore: the GLM lane authenticates with a Foundry deployment and an
api-key, not a subscription session.
The GLM credential is an api-key, not a pi OAuth slot, so the literal `openai-codex` slot key in
`bin/fm-pi-account-home.py`, `bin/fm-crosscheck.py` (`inspect_pi_credential`,
`account_identity`), and the Azure credential archive in `bin/fm-crosscheck-azure.py` stays as it
is - those three still refuse any non-codex pi OAuth slot, which no longer blocks R6 and remains
the recorded constraint if a second pi OAuth provider is ever added.
The identity question those tools answered with `accountId` still needs an answer for an api-key
credential: reviewer identity for the GLM lane must bind the Foundry resource and deployment,
since an api-key carries no account identity of its own.

Work: register the `Fireworks.EnableDeploy` subscription feature, deploy `FW-GLM-5.2`
(pay-per-token Data Zone Standard) and store the key in the fleet's secret custody, never in
the repo; confirm by a small live spend that the charge decrements startup credit; verify the
endpoint passes `reasoning_effort` through and pin the lane to chat completions only; a pi
custom provider entry (`models.json` `baseUrl` +
`openai-completions` api) pointing at the resource's OpenAI-compatible `/openai/v1` endpoint
with the deployment name as the model id; verify pi tolerates `reasoning_content` in streamed
deltas before rollout; extend `bin/fm-crosscheck.py` `allowed_profiles` and roster validation to
carry the GLM lane (today they pin pi to `("pi", "gpt-5.6-sol", "xhigh")` and would refuse it)
with `config/crosscheck-same-model` off; extend the `bin/fm-crosscheck-azure.py` endpoint
allowlist and credential archive for the Foundry host and api-key shape; define reviewer
identity for api-key credentials as above; retire or re-point the interim claude reviewer
artifacts (the `("claude", "claude-opus-5", "xhigh")` `allowed_profiles` entry, the
`api.anthropic.com` allowlist entry, and the claude-profile boot copy described in
`docs/azure-crosscheck.md`); review guards sized to the model's context window at deploy time: a
strict findings schema, path-existence validation before filing, and a per-review context cap;
routing so every crosscheck draws the GLM reviewer, with the pi-codex roster behind a config
flip as fallback (the flip sets `config/crosscheck-same-model` on, accepting same-family review
of codex-authored work as the recorded degraded mode while it is active); and lane visibility:
the review evidence and report name the reviewing lane, and a status command answers whether
GLM is serving or the fallback is active.

Acceptance: a codex-authored change and a claude-authored change are each reviewed by a
GLM-backed reviewer with bound reviewer identity and the same evidence discipline as the codex
lane; the fallback flip to pi-codex is demonstrated once, its activation is visible in the review
evidence and the status read, and the demonstration records the degraded same-family mode it
accepts for codex-authored work.

## R7. Everything is logged in

Status: HOLDS, through R8.

The eight pi profiles renew on their own now, which is R8.
Two of the three profiles in `~/.local/share/agent-fleet/accounts/claude/` hold blanked,
length-zero tokens; the third is `refreshable` with material declared valid to 2026-09-10.
None of the three is needed for R6 anymore: the GLM lane authenticates with a Foundry
deployment key and reviews all authors, so R7 holds with no owner login outstanding.

## R8. Auth refreshes on its own

Status: DONE.

`bin/fm-pi-refresh.py` selects the profiles whose access token dies inside a horizon, copies the
pool, hands the due slots to `bin/fm-pi-refresh.mjs`, republishes each renewed slot into the
account home its consumers read, and re-reads that home through the expiry owner before reporting
success, so its exit code means the fleet is live rather than that an HTTP call returned 200.

The rotation runs through pi's own OAuth flow inside pi's own credential lock, because the
write-back has to land under the lock a running pi takes and the refresh has to happen inside that
same lock or two refreshers spend one refresh token.
It runs host-side because the reviewer compartment's egress allowlist carries the provider's API
host and deliberately not its auth host.

The schedule is one machine-global macOS LaunchAgent, `com.firstmate.pi-auth-refresh`, running
`run-once --all --scheduled` every six hours against a horizon of half the observed ten-day
credential life.
It is machine-global because the pool is: one `auth.json` serves all nine Firstmate homes on this
machine, and every home reads the same job because the installed schedule is identified by what it
runs rather than by which checkout is asking.
A heartbeat counts only when it carries the activation nonce baked into the installed plist, which
reaches a process only through launchd's copy of the job environment, so a hand-typed
`--scheduled` writes nothing and can neither forge proof of life nor destroy the real one.

Acceptance met on 2026-08-19: all eight profiles renewed from 2026-08-25 to 2026-08-29 through the
tool, `bin/fm-credential-expiry.py report` shows eight `usable`, `bin/fm-crosscheck.py`'s own
reader still derives eight distinct accounts, and launchd's own first fire ran a renewal pass and
stamped a matching nonce with `scheduler-status` reporting `installed`.

Residual: the profiles have not yet crossed an expiry boundary unattended, because the first one
they will cross is 2026-08-29. The mechanism is proven; the calendar is not.

## R9. Everything is set up and proven

Status: NOT DONE.

Unproven today: the worker landing path; any validation cell closing; any pi review on the current
model image; and secondmate-in-Azure, which is blocked on R2/R3.

The landing path is not synthetically exercisable, and that is correct behavior rather than a gap
to route around.
`--outcome-dir` requires full staging, and `request` derives every binding from
`$FM_HOME/state/<task>.meta`, with caller-supplied bindings refused outside the hermetic test
backstop.
The existing smoke assignments cannot be reused because their `repository_generation` is not a
commit that exists.
Proving it requires a real spawned crewmate task that commits.

## R10. Crosscheck is exposed to team engineers through Slack

Status: BUILT, ready-to-flip; awaiting the three owner inputs (the Slack app's
two tokens, the GitHub read credential, and the metering numbers). Directed
by the owner 2026-08-19; builds after R6. The lane is
`bin/fm-crosscheck-slack.sh` and its owning document is
`docs/crosscheck-slack.md`; a missing token environment variable refuses
startup naming the exact variable, so flipping it on is supplying tokens, not
changing code. Live acceptance still requires those inputs and an engineer
other than the owner.

What DK must click: create a Slack app in the workspace with Socket Mode on;
mint the app-level token with `connections:write` and the bot token with
`app_mentions:read`, `chat:write`, `channels:history`, and `reactions:write`;
subscribe it to the `app_mention` event, install it, and invite the bot to the
channel(s) going into `channel_allowlist`; mint a read-only GitHub credential
scoped to the allowlisted repositories; export the three values under the
environment variable names in `$FM_HOME/config/crosscheck-slack.json`; and
pick the two metering numbers: `daily_request_cap` (the control that binds
today, counting each submitter's started reviews per day) and
`daily_budget_usd` (the USD bound, which binds only once the crosscheck
ledger records per-review cost; today it does not). Null for either stays
unmetered pass-through, still ledgered. Details and the run recipe:
`docs/crosscheck-slack.md`.

The owner's v1 shape: an engineer tags the crosscheck bot in a Slack channel with a pull request
link; the GLM lane reviews it; the bot posts the findings as a thread reply on the engineer's
own message. No engineer wires up a harness or touches an endpoint, and the same path works for
deliberate on-demand use. Cursor Bugbot continues to run for engineers' pull requests (it stays
disabled on the owner's), so this lane complements rather than replaces it.

Constraints the build must honor:

- The listener uses Slack Socket Mode, so no public inbound endpoint is added to the private
  lane posture. It is a resident process; where it runs is decided at build time and its
  standing cost is recorded under C3.
- v1 accepts pull request links only, and only for repositories in the organization allowlist.
  The bot's repository read credential must never be pointed at a repository outside that
  allowlist, because a review pulls untrusted content into a credentialed context.
- Every thread reply names the lane that produced it (GLM, or the pi-codex fallback), the same
  visibility R6 requires, so engineers and the owner can always see what is serving.
- Team usage is metered per submitter under a daily cost bound (C3); when the bound is reached
  the bot says so in the thread instead of silently dropping the request.

Acceptance: an engineer other than the owner tags the bot with a pull request link and receives
threaded findings produced by the GLM lane, with the lane named in the reply, the request
metered, and an out-of-allowlist link refused with a clear message.

## C1. Crosscheck completes in 20 to 30 minutes

Status: NOT ADDRESSED.

Four parallel lanes (`FM_AZURE_CROSSCHECK_LANES`, default 4) predate this work and nothing about
duration has changed.
The 75 minutes has never been broken down.

Work: instrument create, boot, stage, review, and collect, then pull the lever the measurement
identifies.
Candidates are reviewer VMs that already exist rather than a cold create per review, a faster SKU,
or more lanes, and the choice waits on the measurement.

Acceptance: a measured review completes in 20 to 30 minutes, with the breakdown recorded.

## C2. Many crewmates, no-mistakes, and crosschecks run in parallel without contention

Status: NOT DONE.

All three C2 changes are landed: the transactional apply, the per-slot `pending_actions` map
with its load fence and revision CAS, and the lock discipline that runs every provider mutation
outside the fleet lock under a non-blocking per-slot lease, with the drain after convergence and
`abandon-claim` as the evidence-preserving exit from a deterministically refused claim.
What remains for DONE is the acceptance itself: many crewmates, no-mistakes runs, and
crosschecks demonstrated running in parallel against live capacity without contention.

The lock is the other half, and the harder one: `controller_lock` is held across provider calls
and for an execute's whole guest run, and the code's own note records that fixing only the lock was
tried and reverted.

Work: per-assignment pending state, so reconcile drives many workers concurrently, with
idempotency preserved per action rather than globally, and a lock discipline that puts the provider
call outside the fleet lock.
The first of three changes landed on 2026-08-19: a provider mutation now applies into a copy,
commits only on success, and is refused if its effects reach outside the one compartment its slot
owns.
Two remain: the per-slot pending map with a revision fence, still fully serialized; then the lock
discipline, which has to ship as one change because a half-serialized controller is worse than
either end state.

One thing not to do, found while designing this: the three capacity commands stay fully locked.
`merged_specialized_reservations` ignores local reservations whose status is not `reserved`, so a
candidate parked by one concurrent reserve is invisible to another's admission arithmetic and two
of them can each admit against a budget that fits one.

Acceptance: several crewmates, a no-mistakes offload, and a crosscheck run concurrently without
the controller serializing them.

## C3. Cost guard

Status: NOT DONE.

The requirement is that a day's spend cannot quietly reach 100 dollars.
The only bound that exists is `FM_AZURE_WORKER_COMMISSIONING_CEILING_USD`, which is cumulative
rather than daily, so nothing today refuses a single expensive day.

Workers also do not deallocate on idle.
Compute is released only when an exact release receipt is followed by a controller `reconcile`,
and the sole self-acting bound is a per-VM shutdown schedule at a wall-clock deadline.
The four stranded worker slots were cleaned to zero on 2026-08-19 through the new surrender
lane, and the unattached validation disk by the owner's directed delete, but only by hand:
wkr-04 had
idled about four hours with no release proof until its TTL fired, which is the live example the
idle-release work exists to remove.

Work: a daily spend bound that refuses a mutation once the day's spend crosses it; an idle
release path so an assigned worker whose task ended returns its compute without a human; and,
once R10 exists, the per-submitter daily metering and the listener's standing cost that R10
books here.

Acceptance: a day cannot cross the bound without an explicit operator override, and a worker whose
task ended releases and deallocates unattended.

## Order of work

1. R8, done 2026-08-19.
2. C2, because contention blocks demonstrating anything at scale. One of its three changes landed.
3. R2/R3, the largest architectural gap and the requirement most misread by the current build.
4. R6, whose direction is decided (GLM-5.2 on the Fireworks Foundry lane) and which no longer
   needs an owner login.
5. R4, which needs the runner caller built and one validation cell closed.
6. R5.
7. C1, measured before it is changed.
8. R9, which is the proof of the rest.
9. R10, the Slack team exposure, which needs R6's lane and can be pulled forward right after R6
   if the owner wants engineers on it sooner.

## Standing constraints

Everything enters `main` through a pull request with green CI, and CI is verified to have run
against the head commit rather than against an earlier one.
Every pull request gets a fresh adversarial review before merge, which mutates the production call
site, proves the mutation applied, and confirms the test that should catch it is invoked.
`require_landed_code()` and `require_landed_clean()` are never weakened.
No token value is ever printed or logged; digests, paths, and expiry instants only.
