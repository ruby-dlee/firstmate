# FM_ACCOUNT_DIRECTORY_CUTOVER: direct-pool-rotation-v3
# Spawn a direct report: a new crewmate in a treehouse worktree, an eligible
# pre-cutover Orca direct recovery with empirically verified provider authority,
# or a secondmate in its isolated firstmate home.
# Usage: fm-spawn.sh <task-id> <project-dir> [--harness <name>|harness|launch-command] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>] [--backend <name>] [--account-pool <pool>] [--account-profile <profile>] [--no-account-routing] [--no-provision] [--backlog-row-exemption <test-fixture|tracking-backend-repair>] [--scout]
#        fm-spawn.sh <task-id> [<firstmate-home>] [--harness <name>|harness|launch-command] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>] [--backend <name>] [--account-pool <pool>] [--account-profile <profile>] [--no-account-routing] --secondmate
#        fm-spawn.sh <task-id> --recover-direct-account
#        fm-spawn.sh <task-id> (--resume-account|--continue-account) [--harness <claude|codex>] [--account-pool <pool>] [--account-profile <profile>]
#   --harness <name> is the explicit per-spawn harness/profile adapter. The old
#   positional harness arg still works for back-compat.
#   --model <name> and --effort <low|medium|high|xhigh|max> are concrete profile
#   axes chosen by firstmate at intake. They are only threaded into harnesses whose
#   installed CLIs were verified to support that axis; unsupported axes are omitted
#   from that harness's launch rather than guessed.
#   --backend <name> is the explicit runtime session-provider backend for this
#   spawn. Without it, the script resolves FM_BACKEND, then config/backend, then
#   runtime auto-detection (the runtime firstmate itself is executing inside -
#   $TMUX, HERDR_ENV=1, or cmux runtime signals; bin/fm-backend.sh's
#   fm_backend_detect, with cmux fallback details in docs/cmux-backend.md),
#   then tmux.
#   New-task spawn-capable backends are the reference tmux adapter and
#   experimental herdr, zellij, and cmux. Orca's legacy respawn design owns both
#   the task worktree and terminal, but currently fails closed before provider
#   mutation because its lifecycle authority is unverified. cmux is a session
#   provider only, exactly like herdr/zellij,
#   so it does. An auto-detected herdr or cmux spawn prints a loud stderr notice;
#   auto-detected tmux stays silent; zellij and orca are never auto-detected.
#   codex-app is not a known backend yet; docs/codex-app-backend.md owns that
#   blocked backend contract. Default tmux spawns do not write backend= to meta;
#   absent backend= means tmux. orca and cmux do not support --secondmate spawns.
#   A backend spawn refusal (missing dependency, version gate, unauthenticated
#   socket, or unsupported secondmate mode) is terminal for that selected backend;
#   callers must surface it instead of silently retrying another backend.
#   Cloud placement: FM_SPAWN_CLOUD or config/spawn-cloud selects the existing
#   elastic Azure worker lane. docs/configuration.md "Agent placement" is the
#   single owner of accepted values, precedence, and the durable azure-only
#   policy. fm-spawn resolves and enforces that policy before worktree,
#   endpoint, credential-copy, or cloud-capacity mutation. The recorded
#   metadata carries placement=azure plus the account_home and
#   worktree_git_dir_identity bindings that lifecycle derives its request from,
#   and window= stays empty so local endpoint probes fail closed. Before any
#   Azure worktree, endpoint, controller, or cloud mutation, primary placement
#   loads the private config/azure-controller.env contract owned by
#   docs/configuration.md; explicit invocation values win. Cloud spawns run
#   ENTIRELY on the pi-codex runtime: harness dispatch and claude profile routing
#   are bypassed. account_home comes from
#   config/azure-worker-account-home when that file exists, otherwise from the
#   pi coding-agent directory for backward compatibility. The controller
#   load-balances usable profiles and gives each assignment one private
#   single-profile snapshot; the worker never receives the canonical pool.
#   Ordinary off/default placement keeps the local path byte-identical.
#   FM_SPAWN_PARENT_TASK / FM_SPAWN_PARENT_TASK_GENERATION mark a cloud spawn as
#   a SECONDMATE COMPARTMENT CHILD: both are forwarded to the lifecycle request
#   as --parent-task/--parent-task-generation, where the controller's fan-out,
#   lifetime, parent-liveness and depth bounds apply to them. Only the
#   compartment monitor sets them; every other spawn, including a local
#   secondmate home requesting its own crewmates, leaves them unset and keeps
#   the byte-identical parent-less argv.
#   FM_SPAWN_TASK_HOME names the home the CHILD TASK lives in (state/, data/,
#   projects/) when it is not the home that owns the elastic-worker controller
#   document. Only the compartment monitor sets it, always together with the
#   parent pair. FM_HOME deliberately stays on the primary: it is what names
#   the ONE money document, and moving it would aim the request at a second
#   controller and refuse at the lifecycle's home fence. The path is forwarded
#   as --task-home, which the controller refuses outside a compartment child
#   request and then authorizes against the home's own .fm-secondmate-home
#   marker and the primary's data/secondmates.md registry.
#   With no harness arg, a crewmate/scout spawn resolves the crewmate harness only when
#   config/crew-dispatch.json is absent. When that file exists, crewmate/scout
#   spawns require an explicit harness so firstmate cannot silently skip dispatch
#   profile consultation. A --secondmate spawn is exempt and resolves the SECONDMATE
#   harness (config/secondmate-harness -> config/crew-harness -> own), so the
#   secondmate-vs-crewmate split is DURABLE across every respawn (recovery,
#   /updatefirstmate, restart). A bare adapter name (claude|codex|opencode|pi|grok)
#   overrides it for this spawn (either kind). A non-flag string containing
#   whitespace is treated as a RAW launch command - the escape hatch for verifying
#   new adapters.
#   config/secondmate-harness may also carry an optional model and effort as extra
#   whitespace-separated tokens ("<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]"). For a
#   --secondmate spawn, those tokens apply only when this spawn also resolves its
#   harness from config/secondmate-harness. An explicit per-spawn --harness,
#   positional harness arg, or raw launch command starts with clean model/effort
#   defaults unless the caller also passes explicit --model/--effort flags. When
#   the file governs the spawn, its model/effort tokens are re-resolved on every
#   respawn exactly like the harness axis, and explicit --model/--effort flags
#   still win over the file's tokens.
#   Claude ship/scout launches never inherit the CLI's ambient model.
#   They resolve config/claude-crew-model (inherited into secondmate homes), whose
#   absent-file default and only accepted value is claude-opus-5. An explicit
#   --model must equal that anchor. An empty/default/unresolvable/mismatched model
#   or a raw Claude launch fails closed before endpoint creation.
#   Account routing is independently default-off. Its precedence and off/observe/
#   enforce resolution is owned by fm-account-routing-lib.sh. Direct account-
#   directory launch currently covers ship/scout crewmates only; secondmate
#   integration is deferred and retains legacy Agent Fleet routing.
#   For a NEW routed Claude or Codex ship/scout, fm-account-directory.sh discovers
#   the current user's account homes, chooses one through its direct per-vendor
#   usage contract, installs that profile's Herdr hook, and prefixes the provider
#   command with CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or CODEX_HOME.
#   Existing --account-pool and --account-profile inputs remain compatibility
#   activation signals for new direct launches; their aliases do not constrain
#   the direct usage choice. --no-account-routing remains the emergency per-spawn
#   opt-out and cannot be combined with either account flag. Off launches retain
#   their existing default-identity behavior.
#   config/secondmate-account-pool remains the primary's durable, non-inherited
#   Agent Fleet selection input for secondmate agents when routing is enabled. A
#   secondmate's own crewmates use inherited crewmate dispatch/routing policy, not
#   this setting.
#   --resume-account and --continue-account are legacy recovery paths only for
#   existing account_profile metadata. They retain the sealed Agent Fleet
#   session/lease behavior needed to recover those already-managed generations;
#   ship/scout launches never create that metadata.
#   --recover-direct-account is the ship/scout endpoint recovery path. It reloads kind,
#   project, worktree, harness, backend, model, effort, mode, yolo, and report
#   requirements from metadata and creates only a replacement endpoint in the
#   recorded worktree. Claude and Codex select a fresh account directory. A
#   legacy local Pi task reuses its task-private author snapshot and upgrades
#   missing exact-worktree metadata from the observed, project-bound worktree.
#   A --secondmate spawn also propagates the primary's declared inheritable config
#   into the secondmate home's config/, so the secondmate's OWN crewmates,
#   dispatch profiles, and backlog backend inherit the primary's settings
#   (fm-config-inherit-lib.sh).
#   --scout records kind=scout in the task's meta (report deliverable, scratch worktree;
#   see AGENTS.md task lifecycle); --secondmate records kind=secondmate and launches in a
#   provisioned firstmate home; the default is kind=ship.
#   A genuinely new ship/scout spawn must already have an In flight or Queued row
#   in this home's configured backlog. --backlog-row-exemption accepts only
#   test-fixture or tracking-backend-repair and records the category in metadata.
#   Before a secondmate launch, the home must fast-forward safely to the primary
#   default-branch commit and independently match the live default tip.
#   Any unproven freshness state refuses launch.
#   After a leased worktree passes its identity, cleanliness, and freshness proof
#   and before any endpoint is created, a ship/scout spawn provisions that
#   worktree's declared project dependencies (bin/fm-provision-lib.sh owns the
#   detection, cache, readiness, and bound contracts). A worktree that declares
#   no recognized manifest is a no-op. Otherwise there are exactly two
#   non-success outcomes, and that library's header enumerates both: a
#   CAPABILITY GAP - a component this provisioner was never able to provision -
#   is named on stderr, in the provisioning log, in the spawn's provision=
#   metadata, and in the git-excluded .fm-provisioning.md at the root of the
#   leased worktree - the only one of those the crewmate can read - and launches
#   the lane with that component
#   unprovisioned; a FAILURE - an attempt that was made and did not complete -
#   refuses the spawn, because a lane launched onto a half-built environment is
#   worse than no lane. The task's brief is passed in so an over-budget worktree
#   spends its component budget on what the task actually names.
#   --no-provision skips provisioning for one spawn, and
#   config/worktree-provision=off for the home. Both still clear any
#   .fm-provisioning.md the previous lease of that pool slot left behind, so an
#   opted-out lane cannot read another task's report as its own.
#   Ship/scout spawns refresh the primary checkout before Treehouse acquisition,
#   surface dirty pool entries, and durably lease one available worktree before
#   creating the endpoint. They refuse to create that endpoint unless the leased
#   path is a clean isolated worktree from the requested repository whose HEAD
#   matches its live upstream or local default-branch tip. Dirty acquisitions
#   remain under their durable lease for manual recovery. Other pre-commit
#   failures close the prepared endpoint, restore prior task state, and return
#   only a worktree whose repository identity, cleanliness, and expected detached
#   tip are re-proven before and after owned hook cleanup, with the return held
#   under the common checkout mutation lock.
# Batch dispatch: pass one or more `id=repo` pairs instead of a single <id> <project>, e.g.
#     fm-spawn.sh fix-a-k3=projects/foo add-b-q7=projects/bar [--scout]
#   Each pair re-execs this script in single-task mode, so the single path stays the only
#   source of truth; shared --scout/--harness/--model/--effort/--backend/account
#   flags and --backlog-row-exemption apply to every pair.
#   If config/crew-dispatch.json exists, shared --harness is required for crewmate
#   and scout batches. The loop lives here, in bash, so callers never hand-write a
#   multi-task shell loop (the tool shell is zsh, which does not word-split unquoted
#   $vars and silently breaks ad-hoc `for ... in $pairs` loops).
#   Launch templates live in launch_template() below; placeholders replaced before launch:
#     __BRIEF__    absolute path to data/<task-id>/brief.md
#     __TURNEND__  absolute path to state/<task-id>.turn-ended (for harnesses whose
#                  turn-end signal rides the launch command, e.g. codex -c notify=[...])
#     __PIEXT__    absolute path to state/<task-id>.pi-ext.ts (pi turn-end extension,
#                  written by this script; outside the worktree to avoid pi's trust gate)
#     __PITURNEND__ absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts in a pi secondmate home
#     __PIWATCH__   absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts in a pi secondmate home
# Per-harness turn-end hooks are installed automatically; some live outside the worktree.
# grok uses a firstmate-owned global hook under ${GROK_HOME:-$HOME/.grok}/hooks
# plus a gitignored .fm-grok-turnend worktree pointer and a state token.
# On success prints: spawned <id> harness=<name> kind=<ship|scout|secondmate> mode=<mode> yolo=<on|off> window=<backend-target> worktree=<path>
# mode/yolo are resolved per-project from data/projects.md for ship/scout tasks;
# secondmate spawns record mode=secondmate, yolo=off, home=, and projects=.

# Whether a path provisioning is about to create is ALREADY outside git's view,
# by the project's own ignore rules. It deliberately does NOT write an exclusion
# to make that true.
#
# It used to call exclude_path, and that was wrong in a way worth recording. For
# a linked worktree `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude` resolves to the
# MAIN clone's .git/info/exclude, so provisioning a leased worktree wrote a
# durable, repo-wide rule into the captain's primary checkout and made that path
# invisible to `git status` there. Writing the linked worktree's own
# info/exclude instead does not work - git does not read it - and it would still
# pass this function's read-back check, so the exclusion would silently apply to
# nothing. Per-worktree core.excludesFile via extensions.worktreeConfig does
# work, but it displaces the operator's global excludes inside the worktree and
# is durable config complexity for a case that should be rare.
#
# So provisioning now refuses instead of hiding. A component whose install
# directory the project does not already ignore is one whose installed tree
# would show up as untracked, which fails the returnable check on abort and
# strands the pool lease - the failure that hard-blocks the fleet when every
# workspace is held. Refusing costs that project one line in its own .gitignore;
# guessing costs a lease and mutates a checkout firstmate must never write to.

# prepare_launch_environment: every step the launch-command construction below
# The PATH a crewmate's tool commands run with. A harness executes tool commands
# through a NON-interactive shell, and on this class of host that shell reads only
# ~/.zshenv - never ~/.zprofile or ~/.zshrc, which is where Homebrew puts itself.
# zsh's compiled-in default is /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/local/bin, so a crewmate can
# end up unable to see gh, node, or the axi tooling even though every one of them is
# installed and its worktree is perfectly fine. Crewmates burned whole CI-repair rounds
# on "gh is absent" before this was traced to shell startup rather than the worktree.
#
# Firstmate's own PATH is the seed because it is proven by construction: firstmate
# runs gh-axi, treehouse, and tasks-axi itself. Seeding from it also preserves the
# exact resolution ORDER the host already has, so this cannot silently repoint a
# command (notably `claude`, which a host may front with a shim) - it only ever adds
# reach. The standard locations are appended for the case where firstmate itself was
# launched with a thin PATH; missing directories and duplicates are dropped.
#
# PROVISION_PATH_PREFIX leads when provisioning pinned a runtime the project
# declares (e.g. a .nvmrc Node): the crewmate must validate on the SAME runtime
# its dependencies were installed against, or native modules load against the
# wrong ABI and the lane cannot run its own checks even though node_modules is
# present (data/v3-env-repair-e3/report.md, 2026-08-05). That prefix holds
# EXACTLY node, npm, npx, and corepack (fm_provision_node_path_prefix), never a
# version-manager bin directory - such a directory also holds every globally
# npm-installed CLI for that Node, including the harnesses launched below, so
# leading with it would repoint `claude` or `codex` at whichever copy sits under
# the pinned runtime. The invariant above therefore still holds for every
# command except the Node toolchain the pin exists to fix.

# this line never saw the twelve names the pilot's own require_cloud_environment
# refuses without. That omission made a compartment child's worker impossible to
# create on any machine, in any configuration, which no hermetic test could see
# because they all drive a fixture provider that never shells out to the pilot.
# Still an explicit literal and not a prefix glob: a secret-bearing FM_AZURE_*
