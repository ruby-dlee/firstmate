# Opt-in per-command bridge from repository/no-mistakes shell commands to the
# disposable Azure runner.
#
# FM_AZURE_RUNNER_REMOTE_CLASSES is a comma-separated selection whose entries
# are <command-class>=<resource-class>, for example:
#   test=behavior-heavy,lint=validation-standard
# A missing command class executes locally, preserving today's default.
# Once selected remote, any transport/identity/staging/quota/result failure is
# returned as failure; this bridge never retries the command on the Mac.
# FM_AZURE_RUNNER_LOCAL_RECOVERY_CLASSES is an explicit comma-separated local
# recovery selection and wins only for the named classes.
#
# PER-RUN ROUTING FILE (the authority a daemon-spawned step can actually read).
# A no-mistakes gate step is a child of the machine-global no-mistakes daemon,
# whose launchd job pins its environment to {HOME, PATH}: the operator's
# `export FM_AZURE_RUNNER_REMOTE_CLASSES=... && no-mistakes axi run` never
# reaches it, so that recipe selects nothing at all. Inside a gate worktree this
# wrapper therefore asks bin/fm-azure-runner-routing.py for a routing file keyed
# by the run's OWN id, which it derives from its working directory exactly as it
# derives the task binding below. See that script for the file's contract; the
# rules that matter here are that an ABSENT file means local execution (today's
# default, and what keeps the machine-global empty forever) while a PRESENT but
# broken file refuses and runs the command NOWHERE.
#
# Remote execution requires three per-run bindings. An operator may export all
# of them (the docs/azure-runner.md recipe), and explicit values are passed
# through unchanged. Inside an ambient no-mistakes run nothing exports them,
# so this wrapper is the caller that derives them from the run's own identity:
#
#   FM_AZURE_RUNNER_TASK / FM_AZURE_RUNNER_GENERATION
#     1. Task-worktree metadata: when the command's Git top-level is the
#        recorded `worktree=` of exactly one `$FM_HOME/state/<task>.meta`,
#        the task id is that metadata's name and the generation is its
#        `generation_id`. This is the same worktree-to-task authority the
#        rest of the fleet uses (bin/fm-no-mistakes-reattach.sh,
#        bin/fm-worker-lifecycle.py authoritative_request_bindings).
#     2. no-mistakes gate worktree: gate steps execute inside the daemon's
#        own snapshot at <nm-home>/worktrees/<repo-id>/<run-id> (see
#        bin/fm-nm-step-liveness.sh), which records no firstmate task. The
#        run's own identity is used instead: the task is nm-<run-id> and the
#        generation is the exact snapshot HEAD under validation.
#   FM_AZURE_RUNNER_CONFIRM_SUBSCRIPTION
#     Passed through from the operator environment's FM_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID,
#     explicitly and never invented; absent means refusal.
#
# Every underivable binding fails CLOSED with an exact error naming what is
# missing. There is no silent local fallback on a derivation failure:
# FM_AZURE_RUNNER_LOCAL_RECOVERY_CLASSES stays the only explicit opt-out.
